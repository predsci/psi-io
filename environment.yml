# While psidata should be easy to pip install, it requires HDF libraries.
#
# Generally we recommend installing the python HDF packages using conda.
# This makes it simpler to ensure that the underlying HDF5 and HDF4 libraries
# are properly set up and linked to the python interfaces.
#
# Here is a minimal conda recipe for the psidata dependencies that are
# currently required to build the project. If you only wish to pip install
# the project, you can remove everything past the minimal dependencies.
#
# To create the development environment:
#   $ conda env create -f environment.yml
#   $ conda activate psidata-dev
#
# To remove the development environment:
#   $ conda remove --name psidata-dev --all
#
name: psidata-dev
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
